Welcome to the YouTube Growth Predictor project!

This project uses machine learning to predict the growth of a YouTube channel based on its historical data. The model has been trained on a dataset of YouTube channels and their growth patterns, and it takes into account various features such as the number of views, subscribers, and engagement metrics like likes and comments.

To get started, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
sklearn
matplotlib
Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, you can run the youtube_growth_predictor.py script. This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions on new data. You can modify the script to use your own dataset or to tweak the model hyperparameters.

The data folder contains the dataset used to train the model. The file data/youtube_data.csv contains the raw data, and the file data/processed_data.csv contains the preprocessed data that is used for training and testing the model.

The model folder contains the trained model, which is stored as a pickle file (model/youtube_growth_model.pkl). This file is loaded by the youtube_growth_predictor.py script when making predictions.

The results folder contains the output of the youtube_growth_predictor.py script. The file results/predictions.csv contains the predicted growth rates for the test data, and the file results/evaluation_metrics.txt contains the evaluation metrics (mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc.) for the model.

We hope you find this project helpful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to us!
